### Multi-tasking Experiment

- The experiment is the replication of the original study:  [https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2050-7283-1-18 ]
- The aim of the project: Creating a psychological experiment that compares the multi-tasking skills in men and women. 
- The experiment include a succession of trials in which the performance of women and men in a task-switching paradigm are tested. 
**In the shape task**, participants had to respond to the shape of imperative stimuli (diamonds and rectangles required a left and right response, respectively).
**In the filling task**, participants had to respond to the number of circles within the shape (two and three circles required a left and right response, respectively).

- Participants were informed which task to carry out based on the imperative stimulus location:
If the stimulus appeared in the upper half of the frame, labeled “shape”, they had to carry out the shape
task, and when it appeared in the bottomhalf of the frame, labeled “filling”, they had to carry out the filling task.

**The experiment consists of 3 blocks:** First two blocks were blocks with just one of the two tasks (pure blocks), and in the third block, the two tasks were randomly interleaved (mixed block).

In the mixed block, task-switch trials were those following a trial of the alternative task, and task-repeat trials were those following the same task.

Procedure:
When an imperative stimulus (one of the four shown in Figure 2b) appeared (they were chosen at random by the software), participants had up to 4 seconds to respond. The imperative stimulus disappeared following a response or following the 4 seconds in case no response was given. Incorrect responses (or failures to respond) were followed by a 5 seconds lasting reminder of the stimulus-response mapping,
and then followed by a 500 ms pause. The intertrial interval lasted 800 ms.

The response time is recorded.
